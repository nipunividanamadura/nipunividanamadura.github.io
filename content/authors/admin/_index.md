## About Me

Hi, I’m Nipuni Vidanamadura—a detail-driven finance professional with 4 years of experience in tax administration, training, and taxpayer services. I’ve worked across areas like payroll, GST/HST, and both corporate and non-corporate taxation, and I take pride in making the complex feel approachable for everyone from new hires to everyday Canadians.

My path into this field wasn’t linear (unless you count tax forms). With a Biomedical Science degree from uOttawa and a pandemic-era federal hiring program, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of taxes—and unexpectedly falling in love with it. Over the years, I’ve supported thousands of taxpayers and mentored 40+ colleagues, blending technical know-how with a calm, people-first approach.

Outside of spreadsheets and CRA manuals, you’ll find me sketching, baking, or hiking to recharge. I also share my home—and my Zoom calls—with Tigger, a cat with zero interest in taxes and 100% interest in my keyboard.
