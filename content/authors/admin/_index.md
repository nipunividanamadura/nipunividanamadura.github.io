#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Nipuni Vidanamadura‚Äîa detail-driven finance professional with 4 years of experience in tax administration, training, and taxpayer services. I‚Äôve worked across areas like payroll, GST/HST, and both corporate and non-corporate taxation, and I take pride in making the complex feel approachable for everyone from new hires to everyday Canadians.

My path into this field wasn‚Äôt linear (unless you count tax forms). With a Biomedical Science degree from uOttawa and a pandemic-era federal hiring program, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of taxes‚Äîand unexpectedly falling in love with it. Over the years, I‚Äôve supported thousands of taxpayers and mentored 40+ colleagues, blending technical know-how with a calm, people-first approach.

Outside of spreadsheets and CRA manuals, you‚Äôll find me sketching, baking, or hiking to recharge. I also share my home‚Äîand my Zoom calls‚Äîwith Tigger, a cat with zero interest in taxes and 100% interest in my keyboard.
